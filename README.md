## Parking Lot User Interface

This is a NextJS project that consumes the API endpoints built in the [Parking Lot API](https://github.com/thraxxdv/parking-lot-api) repository.

This user interface was not meant to be a well-designed solution catered to ordinary users but rather a simple means of visualizing data and functionality from the API mentioned above.
